# DS-Bootcamp-Capstone-Mondayball
Data Science &amp; Machine Learning Data Capstone based on Moneyball dataset


This project was promped by a Data Science & Machine Learning bootcamp on the topic of "Moneyball", which is a film named after the 2002 Oakland A's player recruitment strategy, which prioritized non-conventional player evaluation techniques. This was an effort to compete against other teams in the league which had much larger recruitment budgets. 

The objective of the project is to recommend overlooked, cheaper players based on unconventional metrics linked to wins such as on-base percentages.
